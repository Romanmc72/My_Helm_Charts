# My Helm Charts
Well hello there! These are my helm charts. I use them to test and deploy applications either locally on minikube or in production kubernetes clusters. I have one kubernetes cluster at home that I put together using some old computers. Feel free to take a look at what I have here. Nothing is guaranteed to work for you or your system and it may not even work for mine yet. I will document things as much as I can but remember to have fun and google things often.

## Wait what is Helm?
Again, you can just google it, but [here](https://helm.sh/) is a link to the documentation. I use it because it is an easy way to bundle up reusable code for kubernetes applications.

# Monero Mining in K8s

A lot of this was covered in [the dockerfile repo](https://github.com/Romanmc72/My_Dockerfiles/tree/main/mining/monero/) where I defined these containers. Feel free to check that out. I will not repeat myself here, but instead focus on what the kubernetes setup looks like for the cluster that I am running on.
